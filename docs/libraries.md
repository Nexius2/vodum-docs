The **Libraries** module is where you manage **what content is shared** with users on each server.

---

## 📚 What you can do

- List all libraries discovered on each server
- Enable/disable sharing per user
- Apply Plex sharing parameters (when relevant), such as:
  - `allowSync`
  - `allowCameraUpload`
  - `allowChannels`
  - `filterMovies`, `filterTelevision`, `filterMusic`

---

## 🔁 Apply changes

Changes are usually applied by tasks that push updates to servers.

!!! tip
    If you need immediate application, run the relevant task manually from the Tasks page (if your UI supports it) and then check Logs.

---

## ✅ Good workflow

1. Ensure libraries are synced from servers
2. Assign libraries to users (or per policy outcome)
3. Run/apply access update tasks
4. Verify with Monitoring → Libraries
